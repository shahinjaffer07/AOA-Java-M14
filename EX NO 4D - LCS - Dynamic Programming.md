# EX 4D Longest Common SubSequence - Dynamic Programming.
## DATE:25/10/25
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
Constraints:

1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Algorithm
1. Start and read two input strings text1 and text2.

2.Create a 2D array dp[m+1][n+1], where m and n are the lengths of the strings.

3.For each character pair (i, j), compare text1[i-1] and text2[j-1].

4.If they match, set dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1; else set dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]).

5.After filling the table, dp[m][n] gives the length of the Longest Common Subsequence.

            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }

        String text2 = sc.nextLine().replaceAll("\"", "");
        int lcsLength = sol.longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2);
        System.out.println("Length of Longest Common Subsequence: " + lcsLength);
        sc.close();
